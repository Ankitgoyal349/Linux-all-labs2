Question:
Create the operator1 user and confirm that it exists in the

Create a user with a home directory:
sudo useradd -m username
Create a user with a specific shell:
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash username
Lock and unlock user accounts:
# Lock a user account
sudo passwd -l username

# Unlock a user account
sudo passwd -u username
