Experiment 8

Question:
Write shell scripts to print system information.
Write shell script to perform basic mathematical calculation.


Step1:
System Information Commands
hostname → Displays the system's hostname.
lsb_release -d → Shows the operating system description (works on Debian/Ubuntu).
uname -r → Prints the kernel version.
lscpu → Displays detailed CPU information.
free -h → Shows available and used memory in human-readable format.
df -h / → Displays disk usage of the root (/) directory in human-readable format.
awk → A text-processing tool used to filter and format output.
cut -f2- → Extracts specific fields from text (used to get OS name).




Step2:
Mathematical Calculation Commands
read → Reads user input.
echo → Prints text or variable values to the terminal.
case ... esac → A conditional statement to handle multiple choices.
$((expression)) → Performs integer arithmetic operations.
bc → A command-line calculator for floating-point arithmetic.
chmod +x filename → Makes a file executable.
./filename.sh → Runs a shell script.



Conclusion:
Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Linux. In this session, we created:

System Information Script (sys_info.sh) → Fetches and displays essential system details like hostname, OS, kernel version, CPU info, RAM, and disk usage.
Basic Calculator Script (calculator.sh) → Takes user input and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
