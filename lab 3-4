Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of 
characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, 
or a sequence expression. The result includes the text that 
precedes or follows the brace definition.

The man command is used to access the manual page for a specific command.

Step2:
Searching for Commands Related to ext4:
The man -k command searches for commands associated with a specific keyword.

Step3:
Using Brace Expansion:
Brace expansion is used to generate strings efficiently.




Conclusion:
In this lab, we:
Used the man command to view manual pages.
Searched for commands related to ext4 using man -k.
Demonstrated the use of brace expansion for generating strings.
